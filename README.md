# Voting System Smart Contract

This repository contains a smart contract for a simple voting system. The smart contract is implemented using Solidity and can be deployed on networks EVM. The contract allows for the creation of multiple elections, each with multiple candidates, and provides functionality for users to vote in these elections.

## Prerequisites

Before testing and deploying the contract, make sure you have the following software installed:

- Node.js and npm
- Hardhat
- Ethereum wallet like Metamask (for interacting with the deployed contract)

## Installation

To set up the project, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository:

```
git clone https://github.com/ShishkoTryas/blockchain-based-voting-system-agreement
```

2. Navigate to the project directory and install dependencies:

```
cd Voting-System-Smart-Contract
npm install
```

## Testing

The repository includes tests implemented using Hardhat, Mocha, and Chai. To run the tests, execute the following command:

```
npx hardhat test
```

The tests cover various scenarios and edge cases to ensure the contract functions as expected.
